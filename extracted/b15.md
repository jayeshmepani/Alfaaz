Hark, what audacity the moon doth show,
On this lonely, starry, hazy night, y'know?
It hangeth there, a ghostly, silver gleam,
Just watchin' o'en this wild and fleeting dream.

This whole mishmash of life, this fated game,
It sees the love, the beauty, and the flame.
Forsooth, 'tis nature's law, a grand design,
A witness to it all, a silent sign.

So one looks up, a soul beneath the vast,
Thinkin' on the die that has been cast.
It's kinda beautiful, this cosmic stuff,
And for this moment, 'tis more than enough.
