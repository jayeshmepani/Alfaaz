**Image 1**

Why do I find you so appealing? If I get time, I'll ponder.
What've I seen in you? If I get time, I'll ponder.

The whole city claims acquaintance, but
Who is truly mine? If I get time, I'll ponder.

I asked you to make some time to meet,
You wrote back saying, "If I get time, I'll ponder."

In the weather, fragrance, morning breeze, moon, twilight, and stars,
Who is like you? If I get time, I'll ponder.

Either follow your heart or heed the world's advice,
Your suggestion is good, but if I get time, I'll ponder.

Why do I find you so appealing? If I get time, I'll ponder.

Beneath the stillness where whispers grow,
Dost thou sigh, as the night sets aglow?
Thy gaze, like glass, holdeth shadows deep,
While stars above in silence keep.

The air hums faint, a chilled embrace,
As time itself forgets its pace.
Thine eyes, they shimmer, yet truths they hide,
A quiet tempest by the lake's cold tide.

I see not in thy touch what thou dost mean,
Yet feel thy heart in the spaces between.
Thy silence hums with echoes unspoken,
A bond eternal, though words lay broken.

Oh, thou dost set my soul alight,
A flame that danceth with the night.
Wilt thou, dear heart, cast shadows away,
Or let the moon guard truths we can't say?

Tale of love is settled in the moon;
Beauty is evenly fictionalised with the moon;
Every phase has their even zestful sway of the moon
To make us fond of the moon...

Every all what we see
isn't what it's be.

Nothing seems to be perfect
while acknowledging after while
you right although wrong

Sometimes time repeats itself for your deeds
to make you realize what you did.

Tranquility of night
along gazing the
moon & stars brings
placidity of heart.

वफ़ा कभी ग़ैरो या अपनो मैं नहीं होती,
वफ़ा तो फ़ितरत और तरबियत मैं होती है;
और जब वफ़ा का अंदाज़ शिकन और ग़ारत होने लगे, तब बेवफ़ाई होती है।

~ Joey
