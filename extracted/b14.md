The Scenic Ballad of Our Stars

Methinks this love feels surreal, like a dream,
Driftin' upon the universe's stream.
I stand here gazing at the night sky deep,
While memories of thee, my heart doth keep.
The gentle breeze whispers a sensual tune,
Beneath the silver watch of stars & moon;
No cloud can hide, nor shadows ever conceal,
The beauty of this scenic truth I feel.

Thou hast that magic in thy hazel green,
The fairest sight my soul hath ever seen.
Thy fringe doth fall softly upon thy face,
Like flowers bloomin' in a sunlit place.
I see thy hazelnut mocha brown hairs flow,
With essence of those sweet citrus flowering pheromones aglow—
A scent that pulls me in, wild and devine,
To make me wish that thou were wholly mine.

Our yesters melt & slowly start to fade,
Like ripples on a lake within the shade.
But nexts await, glorious and bright,
Turning the cold into the warm sunlight.
The blues're banished when I see thy smile,
Which makes the steepest mountains worth the mile.

Thy touches of your softness calm the sea,
An ocean vast where I just wanna be.
Thou art the apple of my eye, it's clear,
Dispelling every doubt & every fear.
There ain't no would, nor could, nor should imply,
That I would leave thee 'neath the open sky.
Thy vibrance shines thru yellows & the grey,
Turning the darkest night to bright of day.

So grant me, love, yet one distinct embrace,
To hold forever in this sacred space.
Let nature sing in rhythm with my plea,
For thou art all the world, and more, to me.
No longer need I gaze on stars afar,
For thou, my lovely Chica, art the star.
