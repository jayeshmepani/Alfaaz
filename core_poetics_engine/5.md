Yes — **those libraries you listed** (`spacy`, `nltk`, `textstat`, `syllables`, `prosodic`, `pronouncing`, plus `stanza`, `textacy`, `gensim`, `transformers`, `sentence‑transformers`, `poetrytools`, `python‑Levenshtein`, `textdescriptives`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`, `scikit‑learn`) give you **very strong NLP support and analysis tools**, and they *do cover more than just English*, but *not all languages automatically or perfectly* without additional language‑specific resources. Here’s how it breaks down with respect to your needs: ([spacy.io][1])

---

## 🌍 1. **Multilingual Coverage in spaCy**

spaCy supports **75+ languages** and has **84 pretrained pipelines for ~25 languages**, including multilingual tokenization, POS tagging, lemmatization, dependency parsing, etc. This gives you a **basis for analyzing text beyond English**. ([spacy.io][1])

However:
✔ spaCy’s high‑accuracy transformer models like `en_core_web_trf` are mainly for English.
✔ For non‑English languages, spaCy provides lighter models (and some with full pipelines), but coverage varies by language.

So:
➡ spaCy *helps* with multilingual NLP, but its coverage is uneven for non‑English languages.

## 🌐 2. **Strong Multilingual NLP via Stanza**

`stanza` was designed as a **multilingual NLP toolkit** and supports **many human languages with pretrained models** for tokenization, morphology, POS tagging, dependency parsing, NER, etc. — including languages besides English (and Asian languages) because it’s based on Universal Dependency treebanks for ~66 languages. ([arXiv][2])

So Stanza directly expands your ability to parse and analyze text not just in English but many world languages.

## 🇮🇳 3. **Indic Language NLP: iNLTK & Indic NLP Library**

The libraries you considered cover Indian languages:

### 📌 **iNLTK**

* Provides pretrained NLP models and features such as tokenization, embeddings, sentence similarity, etc.
* Specifically supports **Indic languages including**:
  Hindi (hi), Punjabi (pa), Gujarati (gu), Malayalam (ml), Bengali (bn), Tamil (ta), Urdu (ur), Sanskrit (sa), Marathi (mr), Kannada (kn), Nepali (ne), and Oriya (or). ([GeeksforGeeks][3])

This means using iNLTK you *can* get language support for many languages relevant to your MD files.

---

### 📌 **Indic NLP Library**

* A general library for **Indian languages** with tools for text normalization, tokenization, script conversion, romanization, transliteration, syllabification, etc. ([Anoop Kunchukuttan][4])
* Works for a broad list of languages that use Indic scripts and can prepare text correctly for further analysis.

That means your pipeline can accurately *process Indian language text* down to token/syllable levels.

---

## 📚 4. **IndoWordNet for Semantic Resources**

Though not in your install list, **IndoWordNet** is a lexical database linking semantic wordnets of **18 Indian languages** including Gujarati, Hindi, Urdu and others — useful for semantic analysis, similarity, or disambiguation tasks across languages. ([Wikipedia][5])

You could integrate this later for deeper semantic tasks.

---

## 🧠 5. **Limitations to Be Aware Of**

Even with all the libraries you plan to install:

### ⚠ Language nuance and depth

* Tools like spaCy or Stanza provide *syntactic parsing*, but deeper literary nuance (poetry rhythm, creative metaphors, cultural context, stylistic subtlety) is still mostly algorithmic approximation.
* Some languages may not have transformer‑level models in Stanza (smaller UD treebanks).

### ⚠ Scripts & Preprocessing

* Indic languages often require script‑aware tokenizers and normalization — which is where libraries like **Indic NLP Library** and **iNLTK** are crucial.
* Out‑of‑the‑box universal models (like spaCy’s multilingual) may not always handle script/word segmentation correctly without preprocessing.

---

## 📌 Final Summary

### Your current package list *does* support:

✅ English (Old, Middle, Modern)
✅ Multilingual NLP via spaCy models
✅ Deep multilingual parsing via **Stanza**
✅ Indian languages including Hindi, Gujarati, Urdu, Punjabi, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Sanskrit, etc. (when paired with iNLTK & Indic NLP Library) ([GeeksforGeeks][3])

### If you want absolute coverage of all non‑English languages in your MD files you *should augment*:

➡ **iNLTK & Indic NLP Library** — for Indic language tokenization, scripts, sentence splitting, etc.
➡ **IndoWordNet** — for semantic networks across Indian languages.

---

## 📌 Recommended Additional Installs for Full Multilingual Support

You should consider installing:

```bash
pip install inltk
pip install indic-nlp-library
pip install pyiwn
```

* `inltk` brings pretrained models for many Indic languages. ([GitHub][6])
* `indic-nlp-library` enhances tokenization, normalization, and script utilities. ([Anoop Kunchukuttan][4])
* `pyiwn` gives access to IndoWordNet lexical resources. ([Wikipedia][5])

---

## 📌 Conclusion

✅ Your original library list + these suggested additional ones *will* give you broad, real multilingual coverage — beyond English — including Indic and other world languages, suitable to support the workflows described in your two MD files.

Would you like a **full multilingual NLP pipeline example** using these libraries (e.g., how to preprocess and parse text in Hindi, Gujarati, and Urdu)?
