Yes — **beyond the libraries you already listed** (`spaCy`, `nltk`, `textstat`, `syllables`, `prosodic`, `pronouncing`), there are *additional Python packages and tools* that are highly useful for comprehensive poetry and text analysis (especially for implementing the logic in your MD files). Some aren’t mandatory, but they **significantly improve coverage and accuracy** of various linguistic and computational tasks.

Here’s a well‑rounded list of **extra packages** you can install (along with reasons *how/why* they help):

---

## ✅ **Extra Libraries & Tools You Should Consider**

### 🧠 **Linguistic / NLP Enhancements**

These extend basic NLP capabilities beyond spaCy + NLTK:

#### 📌 **Stanza**

* A powerful neural NLP toolkit from Stanford
* Supports over **60+ languages** for tokenization, POS tagging, dependency parsing, NER, etc. ([arXiv][1])
* Useful especially if you want multilingual capabilities beyond spaCy

```bash
pip install stanza
```

---

#### 📌 **Textacy**

* Built on top of spaCy
* Adds *advanced preprocessing*, *text feature extraction*, *n-grams*, *lexical statistics*, and *semantic analysis* ([GeeksforGeeks][2])
* Great for deeper metric extraction and custom text features

```bash
pip install textacy
```

---

#### 📌 **Gensim**

* For *semantic and topic analysis* using word vectors, LSI, LDA, etc. ([GeeksforGeeks][2])
* Very useful if your MD logic requires semantic similarity/meaning modeling

```bash
pip install gensim
```

---

#### 📌 **Hugging Face Transformers**

* Access to state‑of‑the‑art pretrained models (BERT, GPT, etc.) for semantic analysis
* Critical for deeper contextual understanding beyond basic spaCy models

```bash
pip install transformers
pip install sentence‑transformers
```

---

### 🧩 **Poetry / Prosody / Sound‑Based Libraries**

#### 📌 **Poetry‑Tools**

* A package specifically designed for *poem analysis* (rhyme, meter, schemes) using CMU Pronouncing Dictionary ([GitHub][3])
* Adds reliable tools to support meter detection and rhyme patterns

```bash
pip install poetrytools
```

---

#### 📌 **python‑Levenshtein**

* Efficient distance computation (used by poetry tools to evaluate meter similarity, rhyme distance) ([GitHub][3])

```bash
pip install python‑Levenshtein
```

---

### 📊 **Additional Quantitative / Text Metrics**

#### 📌 **TextDescriptives**

* A specialized tool for calculating textual statistics on top of spaCy ([arXiv][4])
* Useful for metrics your MD files might define (lexical complexity, counts, etc.)

```bash
pip install textdescriptives
```

---

### 📈 **Graphing / Visualization (Optional)**

If you want visual output for metrics:

```bash
pip install matplotlib seaborn plotly
```

---

### 🧠 **Machine Learning / Deep Semantic Models**

If you want deeper embedding or classification:

```bash
pip install scikit‑learn
```

## 💡 Why These Matter

Even though your base list *(spaCy, NLTK, textstat, syllables, prosodic, pronouncing)* covers a lot of ground, these extras help with:

🌟 Advanced **semantic accuracy** (transformers, gensim)
🌟 Multi‑language NLP beyond English (stanza)
🌟 Richer text features and statistical metrics (textacy + textdescriptives)
🌟 More *poem‑specific* analysis like rhyme, meter similarities (poetrytools + Levenshtein)
🌟 Smooth integration and richer analysis pipelines

All of these support deeper coverage of the analytical logic in your two MD files and help approximate difficult tasks with much better reliability than using only the bare minimum packages. ([GeeksforGeeks][2])

## 📌 Final Installation Command Suggestions

Here’s a full suggested installation set:

```bash
pip install spacy nltk textstat syllables prosodic pronouncing
pip install stanza textacy gensim transformers sentence-transformers
pip install poetrytools python-Levenshtein textdescriptives
pip install matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
```

And **don’t forget** to load the spaCy models:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf
python -m spacy download xx_sent_ud_sm
```
